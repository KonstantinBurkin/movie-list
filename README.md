# movie list

## Motivation for this project
- I want to keep detailed log of movies I watched 
- Analyze what genres or directors I prefer
- Retrospect how my tastes change over time
- Share the movies I liked with my friends

## Data sources
- Initially, I used the movies list, that I kept over years. The last version of that list was published on [google spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDdGrNWN3QnSgB_7Tj-hoDe1mEKkivMk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106349676610417203719&rtpof=true&sd=true) until I moved the logs here.
- I obtain additional movie credentials from [omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Future work
- to make movies table interactive (sorting, filtering)
- add subpages with analytics
